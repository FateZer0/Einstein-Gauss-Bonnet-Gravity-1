# Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Gravity
The present codes were devised for the study of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models for the inflationary era with respect to the GW170817 event. The whole premise was the construction of a theory which produces primordial gravitational waves which propagate through spacetime with the velocity of light. Such an assumption constrains the overall phenomenology. Here, two cases are presented, either the scalar potential is designated freely or the Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function. The choice is of course up to the viewer. The current models are presented for simplicity, this however does not imply that they are compatible with observations. The devised codes are quite flexible and are presented in the non-minimally coupled case for the sake of generality. Articles reffering to such model construction are available in the comments of the first code. Both codes are available for distribution.
