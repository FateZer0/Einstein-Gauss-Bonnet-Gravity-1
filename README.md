# Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Gravity
The present codes were devised for the study of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models for the inflationary era with respect to the GW170817 event. The whole premise was the construction of a theory which produces primordial gravitational waves which propagate through spacetime with the velocity of light. Such an assumption constrains the overall phenomenology. Here, only one case is presented where the scalar potential is designated freely and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function is derived from the continuity equation of the scalar fieldhowever working the other way around is also a viable option. The current model is presented for simplicity, this however does not imply that the code executes the orders fast, since everything is designated as a function. However, the devised code is quite flexible and is presented in the non-minimally coupled case for the sake of generality. Articles reffering to such model construction are available in the comments.Such code is ofcourse available both for use and distribution.
